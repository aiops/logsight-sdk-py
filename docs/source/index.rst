Quickstart: Detecting Incidents
*******************************

*27/09/2021, 30 minutes to complete*

Get started with the Logsight SDK for Python and client library to detect incidents.
Follow these steps to install the package and start using the algorithms provided by logsight.ai service.
The incident detector client library enables you to find incidents in your logs
by automatically using deep learning models trained on millions lines of code, regardless of the underlying IT system, failure scenario, or data volume.

Use the Logsight SDK for Python to:

+ Send data logs to your logsight.ai account
+ Detect incidents in your data logs
+ Retrieve and display the log records associated with an incident
